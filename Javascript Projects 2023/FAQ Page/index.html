    <h1>My game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title what does that mean</h1>
    <p class="answer1">When you purchase an Xbox Play Anywhere title digitally, it's yours to play on both Xbox and Windows. You only need to purchase the game once via the Microsoft Store on your Xbox or Windows device and it'll appear in your game library wherever you sign in.
      If you've purchased the game on Xbox and want to play it on your Windows device, sign in on your device. If the game is already installed on your device, it'll appear in your list of apps. Otherwise, you can install it by opening the Store app and selecting My library.
      If you've purchased the game on Windows and want to play on your Xbox console, sign in on your console, press the Xbox button  to open the guide, and select My games & apps > See all > Games. If the game is already installed, it'll appear in your game list. If it's not yet installed, you'll see a download icon on its game tile. Select the game tile and then select Install, or to see more options, select Choose what to install.
